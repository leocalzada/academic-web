## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Rutgers University and a National Geographic Explorer, studying the impacts of state-driven conservation and development interventions, such as the Mayan Train and "Sembrando Vida," on forest dynamics and local governance in the Yucatan Peninsula. My work draws on politcal ecology, ecological modeling, and spatial methodologies to propose collaborative tools for analizing the interplay between human and ecological communities in tropical forests while considering local viewpoints and ecological complexities.
